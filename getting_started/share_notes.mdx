Sharing is caring. So why not share your meeting summaries and action items with other attendees, friends, and/or your colleagues, regardless of whether they are users of our platform or not? 

### How can you share your notes with others?
There are two ways in which you can share your summaries with others. You can:

1. Share it with one click with participants or via email
2. Copy-paste your meeting notes
3. Create a URL

### Sharing via email
We all have little time, so that's why sharing a summary should be quick and easy. In jamie you can share your summary with the click of a button. You can either share it with:

- Selected individual participants of your meeting
- All participants
- Other parties by simply adding their email 

<Note>
**Note:** The summary will not be sent out to all participants automatically. You are in full control of who will receive a meeting summary from you to avoid spamming people. 
</Note>

<Warning>
**Important:** The participants of the meeting will only show if you have connected your calendar with Jamie.
</Warning>

### Sharing through copy-paste
Once you have opened your meeting note, you can copy-paste your summary, action items, and transcript into any document or knowledge hub of your liking. 

Simply use the copy button at the top right of each output field to copy the content. Then, right-click or use the paste shortcut on your device to paste the content into your document.

### Sharing through a URL
Alternatively, you can generate a URL by clicking on the **Share** button in the upper right corner of your meeting note window. 

<Warning>
**Important:** To create a URL for your meeting notes, you have to first switch the slide bar to the right. You will then be able to copy and share the URL with others.
</Warning>

While notes can be shared with others, **only you** have the right to edit these notes. Others have viewing rights only and cannot make changes to your meeting notes.

<Warning>
**Important:** Any changes made to the meeting notes by yourself will also update the URL that you have previously shared with others.
</Warning>

### Deactivating your public link
Creating a URL and sharing it with others does not mean that they can have unlimited access to your summary notes.

You can deactivate the public link to your meeting summary anytime by switching the slide bar again to the left.

Now, others are **no longer able to access** your summary via a web browser.
