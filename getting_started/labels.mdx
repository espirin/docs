With our label feature, you can now categorize your meeting notes, helping you to filter your summaries based on projects, clients, and more.

### What are labels?
Labels are keywords that you can attach to different meeting notes to easily classify and categorize them. Since they are fully customizable, you can create labels from any kind of words or numbers. 

### How to create labels? 
To create a label in Jamie, head to your settings and go to the tab **Labels**. Click on **Add label**, type in any label name you like, and hit enter.

Jamie automatically assigns different colors to your labels, but you can also easily customize this to your liking.
