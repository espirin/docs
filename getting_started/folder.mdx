By default, your meeting notes will appear under recent meetings and are **not** shared automatically with your workspace.&#x20;

You can allocate your meetings into either a private or shared folder. If allocated into a shared folder, all members in your workspace can view your meeting summaries.&#x20;

Folders can be:&#x20;

* Projects

* Clients

* Departments

* Teams

* Jobs to be done

* etc.
