Once Jamie has generated your meeting notes, you can make changes to your **summary, action items, and your transcript.**

To edit content, just click where you want to edit something and start typing.&#x20;

You are now able to add additional bullet points within your summary by pressing **Enter**, start a list by adding **1.** and make changes or delete current content across all elements of your meeting notes.
