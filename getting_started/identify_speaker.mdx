description: How to identify speakers in Jamie.
---

To identify speakers in a meeting, Jamie uses a speaker identification process. After your meeting notes have been generated, you'll be asked to listen to an audio clip and identify the speakers who attended the meeting. 

This information will then be used to include speakers' names in both your meeting summary and your transcript. 

<Note>
**Note:** Once a speaker is identified, Jamie will remember this information and automatically identify speakers in future meetings. There is no need to identify the same speaker more than once.

### How does the speaker identification process work

**GIF**

1. Click on the play button of each audio clip
2. Listen to the audio clip of each speaker
3. Type in the speaker's name in the text field right next to the audio clip
5. Click "Continue" to access your meeting notes.


<Warning>
**Note:** The number of speakers identified by Jamie might be more or less than the number of active speakers in the meeting. This is caused by variating audio quality during meetings or fast speaker turns.

## FAQs

<Accordion title="Q1: Why do I have more or less identified speakers than participants in the meeting?">
    In very few cases, the number of speakers identified in Jamie can differ from the actual count of active participants. This is due to variating audio quality during meetings or fast speaker turns. Jamie might identify the same speaker as two different speakers, or miss a speaker. Reasons can be background noise, internet issues, or microphone issues. Just add the same name twice and Jamie will add it to the summary.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q2: What if the audio clip does not play any sound?">
    If the audio clip does not play any sound, just don't enter any name. This can be because Jamie identifies loud background noise or other noises during the meeting. If it turns out that Jamie did assign a speaker to that voice, you can change it in the summary.

<Accordion title="Q3: Can I edit the speaker after the speaker identification is done?">
    Currently, you can not edit the speakers once you hit continue. However, we are currently working on a solution to give users the ability to edit the identified speakers later. We will probably ship a new update, so stay tuned and check out our [Changelog](https://www.meetjamie.ai/changelog)
